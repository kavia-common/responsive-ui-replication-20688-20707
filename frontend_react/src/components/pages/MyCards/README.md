# MyCards React Page

This page replicates the "My cards" Figma screen using React and scoped CSS modules, following the Ocean Professional style.

- Styles are scoped via `MyCards.module.css`.
- Interactivity:
  - CVV visibility toggled with React state (no direct DOM manipulation).
- Assets:
  - Uses images from `/assets/figmaimages/...` which are available in the project-level `assets` folder served statically.

Usage:
Import the page and render it within the App (already integrated in `src/App.js` with a simple view switcher).
